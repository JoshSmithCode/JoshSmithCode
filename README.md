# JoshSmithCode

It looks like this readme shows up on my github profile now! Well, let me say, my name is Josh Smith, I'm a full-stack web developer and I LOVE my work. 

This repo is another mini project teaching myself F#. Currently using Bolero to compile to Web Assembly. WIP. 

Install dotnet and then run the below to build/serve

`dotnet run -p src/JoshSmithCode.Server`
